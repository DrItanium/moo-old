moo is a port of the source code to Marathon Infinity to an expert system written in CLIPS. 
The name moo comes from my childhood when I would play marathon infinity at my friend's
house. I always thought that the executable said moo instead of it actually being M 
followed by the infinity symbol. That has always stuck with me because it is so hilarious.

This project is licensed under the GPLv3 but is built on top of the Adventure Engine

Thanks to Bungie for releasing the Marathon infinity source code in its entirety. 

I have merged this code base with the root adventure engine so this project is
now compatible with scummvm and residualvm if such a thing is desired.
